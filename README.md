# DeepSenSe: A Deep Learning Model for Searching Relevant Articles using Sentences

This repo contains the codes for our paper **DeepSenSe: A Deep Learning Model for Searching Relevant Articles using Sentences**.

The codes in this repo include scripts and notebooks for data processing and computation of evaluation metrics under the directory `scripts` and scripts for traning and evaluation of the DeepSenSe under the directory `model`.

We used Python 3.7 in this study. Python packages and corresponding versions are listed in the file `requirement.txt`.

## Data Sources

The original data used for our study are available from the following sources:

- PMC Full-text Articles: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_bulk/
- PubMed Abstracts: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/baseline/
- Journal Citation Reports: https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/journal-citation-reports/
- TREC-COVID Dataset: https://ir.nist.gov/covidSubmit/

Data in the listed sources are updated from time to time. We downloaded the PMC full-text articles and PubMed abstracts on Oct. 23rd, 2019. We used the journal citation report of 2018 and the [TREC-COVID Complete](https://ir.nist.gov/covidSubmit/data.html) dataset.
